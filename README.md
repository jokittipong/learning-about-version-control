Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control is it helps facilitate workflow within group and has history to look back and trace whatever change happened.
What I found most challenging about version control is there are many ways to do the same thing and it's quite confusing me on what exactly I should do on it.
